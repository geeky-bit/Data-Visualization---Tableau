# Data-Visualization using Tableau

I like to work on visualizations in R and Tableau in the spare time.

This repo is just a collection of some basic Workbooks in Tableau where I did the data analysis and exploration.

# Project 1
Dataset used :: Kaggle -- Kobe Bryant Shot selection https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/data

Description :: 

This workbook contains a thorough analysis of all the shots by NBA player Kobe Bryant (Team - Lakers). 

Kobe Bryant marked his retirement from the NBA by scoring 60 points in his final game as a Los Angeles Laker on Wednesday, April 12, 2016. 
Drafted into the NBA at the age of 17, Kobe earned the sportâ€™s highest accolades throughout his long career.
This data contains the location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant took during his 20-year career. The task is to predict whether the basket went in (shot_made_flag).

Mass Shootings in the United States of America (1966-2017) The US has witnessed 398 mass shootings in last 50 years that resulted in 1,996 deaths and 2,488 injured. The latest and the worst mass shooting of October 2, 2017 killed 58 and injured 515 so far. The number of people injured in this attack is more than the number of people injured in all mass shootings of 2015 and 2016 combined.
